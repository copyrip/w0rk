I can't remember the last time I bought a game sur un coup de tÃªte...

Helldiver is quite fun
Its toned like starship troopers meets mars attack
Its designed like the mandalorian series

Apart from good gameplay, nice game design for a issrandomly generated world, a cryptic bestiary...

One thing that took me by surprise was the otherwise insignifcant ship naming system.

You have two list (a bit like "what's your soundcloud rapper name" or other examples

It reminded me of simpler times, cadavres exquis stuff and otherworldy amalgammed mosnter from our childhood

My ship is named : KKKKKKK
i don't know why, I'm not even a ____ fan or something

What this can tell us about the game ?

The devs wanted us to meet,
but they know online gaming culture,
its childiness, rudeness, gore and oftentimes straight up illegal nature ! (yes i'm looking a you xxx_N*g
g*r_Destroyer-

The devs had a world in mind
They wanted us the games to experience and pariticipate in this world, but they knew we could only be trusted that much

Hence resulting in a beautiful list full of possiblites !
