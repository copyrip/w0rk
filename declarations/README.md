* What is your relationship to CSS (or other declarative web-languages)? Do you consider yourself a developer, designer, amateur, artist, thinker?
* How does CSS (or other declarative web-languages) manifest in your pratices, can you give some examples of projects where it took a particular role?
* Do you have other pratices, such as writing, poetry, installation or performance, that you feel could be intertwined with the broader artistic aspect of the worksession?
* What is your experience in collective work?

In addition to your application, to propose a presentation on the 1st of April (not mandatory), answer the following.

**"What story about (CSS or) web-based practices, what would you tell? what type of knowledge or problematics lies in this story?"**


I first played with web pages during 
where we edited pages with Word
before publishing them on the school website

since then, I always created webpages as long as I had a text editor

...

I like to work in a terminal,
    hence I like to work with text
        so I often write READMEs, style.css and other random pages

## css for live streaming

I would be interested in working on a short demo / presentation / performance to talk about how I integrate CSS and web publishing practices in the context of video streaming.

* Can the simplicity of this setup can compare with professional tv habillage ?
* What oddities and quirks do we happily inherit from working like this ?
* How does a whole graphic identity could develop from video to paper, transiting via web based design ?

I think I could do the prez in EN or FR depending on users preferences.
