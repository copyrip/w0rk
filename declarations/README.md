Hello Doriane üññ

Sorry for the late-ish email, but I thought I might still write you about your very exciting proposal.

I don't currently have a working portfolio nor resume. You can find some stuff on the server I maintain ‚Üí http://copyright.rip/ (and this in progress resume if you're really curious)

    What is your relationship to CSS (or other declarative web-languages)? Do you consider yourself a developer, designer, amateur, artist, thinker?
    It is hard to define oneself: sometimes I feel free like an artist, oftentimes I write poor wordpress code to bring food to the table...
    But one remaining constant in my work, is the use of my computer as primary tool.
    Since I discovered a non-GUI usage of machines, I tend to favor typed interface while working: using html/css/js to design my posters, writing documentation in READMEs or wikis, etc...
    As a teacher, I'm working on web2print as a gateway for graphic designers to enter the fabulous world of declarative design, file based computing and programming paradigm.
    How does CSS (or other declarative web-languages) manifest in your pratices, can you give some examples of projects where it took a particular role?
    Communication: css and html are usually my go to when doing documentation websites or posters for projects. It is often intertwined with how I see publishing practices for what I want to talk about, like this unfinished advent calendar.
    Tool: using CSS to draft and design graphics and overlays for live video streaming (more below).
    Do you have other practices, such as writing, poetry, installation or performance, that you feel could be intertwined with the broader artistic aspect of the worksession?
    Performance (and writing to some extent) is a key aspect to live video streaming, which I've been experimenting for a few years.
    What is your experience in collective work?
    As a member of …¥on-·¥Ä, I had the opportunity to curate and produce exhibitions, experiencing various decision making processes and organization of labour. On a day to day basis, I mainly behave as a maintainer for the tools my friends use on our shared server (nextcloud, mediawiki, mails, ...).
    More recently, doing a bit of cleaning and rework of erg's website, I had the opportunity to share the arcane knowledge I had about this old frankenstein website to a variety of people with different technical know-how. Working in a wiki, which is kind of an hybrid between gui and text-based, was an useful foundation for us altogether.


## CSS FOR VIDEO LIVESTREAMING

What story about (CSS or) web-based practices, what would you tell? what type of knowledge or problematics lies in this story?

For a few years we tried various video streaming experiments, with erg.tv, BOZAR, and for my memoire.

As a text-first computer user, I wanted to find ways to design our video output using lightweight techniques, such as graphic webpages to display information, graphics or animation.
This choice was also made in the context of an almost fully open source software chain ! OBS, the key piece of contemporary video streaming, being gracefully licensed under GNU GPL v2.

Using web pages is also one of the most common way to integrate chat, alerts and other viewer based events in the mainstream streaming community, using tools such as Stream Elements  or Stream Maker.

I would be interested in working on a demo / presentation / performance to talk about how I integrate CSS and web publishing practices in the context of video streaming.

You can see this technique in use here (for live subtitling), here (for a waiting screen) and here (for star wars style credits) for example.

    What oddities and quirks do we happily inherit from working like this ?
    How does a whole graphic identity could develop from video to paper, transiting via web based design ?
    How does the simplicity of this setup can compare with the current state of video habillage ?

I think I could do the prez in EN or FR depending on users preferences.

J'esp√®re que tout va bien pour toi ! Je suivrais de toute mani√®re ta recherche avec attention, √ßa √† l'air men√© avec soin üòå

bien √† toi,
Martin ¬©

P.S: I just though about this, but if there is no room for me to join your workession BUT you're still interested in learning a bit about css in a video streaming context, I guess I could cook something to livestream you from abroad üåê
