# Application

**Applications are due on the 29th of February.**

Your application can take the form you prefer: a web-page labyrinth, a poetic email, an interactive pdf, a video of you talking, or others. One or two paragraphs per questions are enough. Please also join your CV.

* What is your relationship to CSS (or other declarative web-languages)? Do you consider yourself a developer, designer, amateur, artist, thinker?
* How does CSS (or other declarative web-languages) manifest in your pratices, can you give some examples of projects where it took a particular role?
* Do you have other pratices, such as writing, poetry, installation or performance, that you feel could be intertwined with the broader artistic aspect of the worksession?
* What is your experience in collective work?

In addition to your application, to propose a presentation on the 1st of April (not mandatory), answer the following.

**"What story about (CSS or) web-based practices, what would you tell? what type of knowledge or problematics lies in this story?"**


I first played with web pages during 
where we edited pages with Word
before publishing them on the school website

since then, I always created webpages as long as I had a text editor

...

I like to work in a terminal,
    hence I like to work with text
        so I often write READMEs, style.css and other random pages

## css for live streaming

For a few years (we)[https://www.youtube.com/@1nd3x__]
For a few years [we](https://www.youtube.com/@1nd3x__) tried various video streaming experiments, with erg.tv, BOZAR, and for my mémoir.

As a text-first computer user, I wanted to find ways to design our video output using lightweight techniques, such as graphic webpages to display infos, images or effects. Using html pages is also one of the most common way to integrate chat, alerts and other viewer based events in the mainstream streaming community, using tools such as →

I would be interested in working on a demo / presentation / performance to talk about how I integrate CSS and web publishing practices in the context of video streaming (with OBS, the open source video broadcast software)

You can see this technique in use here, here and here for example.

* Can the simplicity of this setup can compare with professional tv habillage ?
* What oddities and quirks do we happily inherit from working like this ?
* How does a whole graphic identity could develop from video to paper, transiting via web based design ?

I think I could do the prez in EN or FR depending on users preferences.

As I don't live in brussels anymore it could be a way for me to pay my travel fees.
